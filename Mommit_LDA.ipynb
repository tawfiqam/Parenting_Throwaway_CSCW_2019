       "      <td>Throw out your \"plan\" and just go with it.  Sure, you could get pregnant the first month off the IUD, but it usually takes a few months even for perfectly healthy couples.  Don't count on your Halloween baby.  \"The crazy crying period\" is called postpartum depression and not all new mothers get it.  I never did.  If you are afraid of getting frustrated with your child and you haven't even gotten pregnant yet, you may want to re-evaluate if you are really ready for a child.  All new mothers need a support network.  Get out and join moms groups in your area to meet other moms and babies to play with, especially if you are planning to become a SAHM. Also, don't map out a birth plan...none of them go as expected...babies have their own plans.</td>\n",

       "      <td>We are going to start trying to get pregnant in a few months or so.  (There is something beyond our control right now causing the fuzzy and slightly unknown time frame.) Besides being afraid of labor, how crazy my mother is and will be, the sudden involvement of family neither of us really see or talk to, and the hormones I'm the most worried about once I give birth and we settle into a routine will I feel like I'm on house arrest?  So far I'm making a mental list of things I hope to do with our little one outside of our home.  While he/she is still pretty small and not really mobile yet I'm hoping to get into some new mother groups and find a mommy centric yoga class and an infant exercise/bonding class.  Once he/she's a toddler then trips to the zoo and family day at the art museum.\\n\\n\\nAfter my sister-in-law had her baby she turned into an avid Facebook user.  I believe it was her way of staying in contact with her friends and filling the void of not being away from home everyday interacting with a lot people.  Maybe you and your friends already use Facebook.  As long as you don't overload your updates about your little one it seems like a nice way to stay in the loop.  Emails and texts just feel like they need to be responded to too quickly and sometimes phone calls come at the worst time possible.  \\n\\n\\nI hope everything works out so your baby is born in October.  I was sort of hoping to not be in my second or third trimester in the summer, but the way things are going we are going to have a fall or winter baby, too.  Any thoughts on being pregnant during the summer?  The heat and humidity already zaps all my energy to begin with.  So, I can't imagine being 25 pounds heavier and short of breath when the heat index is 100.</td>\n",

Sure, you could get pregnant the first month off the IUD, but it usually takes a few months even for perfectly healthy couples.  Don't count on your Halloween baby.  \"The crazy crying period\" is called postpartum depression and not all new mothers get it.  I never did.  If you are afraid of getting frustrated with your child and you haven't even gotten pregnant yet, you may want to re-evaluate if you are really ready for a child.  All new mothers need a support network.  Get out and join moms groups in your area to meet other moms and babies to play with, especially if you are planning to become a SAHM. Also, don't map out a birth plan...none of them go as expected...babies have their own plans.     \n",
       "2802  We are going to start trying to get pregnant in a few months or so.  (There is something beyond our control right now causing the fuzzy and slightly unknown time frame.) Besides being afraid of labor, how crazy my mother is and will be, the sudden involvement of family neither of us really see or talk to, and the hormones I'm the most worried about once I give birth and we settle into a routine will I feel like I'm on house arrest?  So far I'm making a mental list of things I hope to do with our little one outside of our home.  While he/she is still pretty small and not really mobile yet I'm hoping to get into some new mother groups and find a mommy centric yoga class and an infant exercise/bonding class.  Once he/she's a toddler then trips to the zoo and family day at the art museum.\\n\\n\\nAfter my sister-in-law had her baby she turned into an avid Facebook user.  I believe it was her way of staying in contact with her friends and filling the void of not being away from home everyday interacting with a lot people.  Maybe you and your friends already use Facebook.  As long as you don't overload your updates about your little one it seems like a nice way to stay in the loop.  Emails and texts just feel like they need to be responded to too quickly and sometimes phone calls come at the worst time possible.  \\n\\n\\nI hope everything works out so your baby is born in October.  I was sort of hoping to not be in my second or third trimester in the summer, but the way things are going we are going to have a fall or winter baby, too.  Any thoughts on being pregnant during the summer?  The heat and humidity already zaps all my energy to begin with.  So, I can't imagine being 25 pounds heavier and short of breath when the heat index is 100.   \n",

Besides being afraid of labor, how crazy my mother is and will be, the sudden involvement of family neither of us really see or talk to, and the hormones I'm the most worried about once I give birth and we settle into a routine will I feel like I'm on house arrest?  So far I'm making a mental list of things I hope to do with our little one outside of our home.  While he/she is still pretty small and not really mobile yet I'm hoping to get into some new mother groups and find a mommy centric yoga class and an infant exercise/bonding class.  Once he/she's a toddler then trips to the zoo and family day at the art museum.\\n\\n\\nAfter my sister-in-law had her baby she turned into an avid Facebook user.  I believe it was her way of staying in contact with her friends and filling the void of not being away from home everyday interacting with a lot people.  Maybe you and your friends already use Facebook.  As long as you don't overload your updates about your little one it seems like a nice way to stay in the loop.  Emails and texts just feel like they need to be responded to too quickly and sometimes phone calls come at the worst time possible.  \\n\\n\\nI hope everything works out so your baby is born in October.  I was sort of hoping to not be in my second or third trimester in the summer, but the way things are going we are going to have a fall or winter baby, too.  Any thoughts on being pregnant during the summer?  The heat and humidity already zaps all my energy to begin with.  So, I can't imagine being 25 pounds heavier and short of breath when the heat index is 100.</td>\n",

Sure, you could get pregnant the first month off the IUD, but it usually takes a few months even for perfectly healthy couples.  Don't count on your Halloween baby.  \"The crazy crying period\" is called postpartum depression and not all new mothers get it.  I never did.  If you are afraid of getting frustrated with your child and you haven't even gotten pregnant yet, you may want to re-evaluate if you are really ready for a child.  All new mothers need a support network.  Get out and join moms groups in your area to meet other moms and babies to play with, especially if you are planning to become a SAHM. Also, don't map out a birth plan...none of them go as expected...babies have their own plans.     \n",
       "4  We are going to start trying to get pregnant in a few months or so.  (There is something beyond our control right now causing the fuzzy and slightly unknown time frame.) Besides being afraid of labor, how crazy my mother is and will be, the sudden involvement of family neither of us really see or talk to, and the hormones I'm the most worried about once I give birth and we settle into a routine will I feel like I'm on house arrest?  So far I'm making a mental list of things I hope to do with our little one outside of our home.  While he/she is still pretty small and not really mobile yet I'm hoping to get into some new mother groups and find a mommy centric yoga class and an infant exercise/bonding class.  Once he/she's a toddler then trips to the zoo and family day at the art museum.\\n\\n\\nAfter my sister-in-law had her baby she turned into an avid Facebook user.  I believe it was her way of staying in contact with her friends and filling the void of not being away from home everyday interacting with a lot people.  Maybe you and your friends already use Facebook.  As long as you don't overload your updates about your little one it seems like a nice way to stay in the loop.  Emails and texts just feel like they need to be responded to too quickly and sometimes phone calls come at the worst time possible.  \\n\\n\\nI hope everything works out so your baby is born in October.  I was sort of hoping to not be in my second or third trimester in the summer, but the way things are going we are going to have a fall or winter baby, too.  Any thoughts on being pregnant during the summer?  The heat and humidity already zaps all my energy to begin with.  So, I can't imagine being 25 pounds heavier and short of breath when the heat index is 100.   \n",

I had read up on it online and it seemed to say that it could be surgically repaired. However, I knew I wanted more kids so I didn’t see a point in getting the issue repaired if it might reoccur. So the issue seemed to fix itself after my second was born. I tore again near the opening (where the tightness was) and it was repaired correctly this time.\n",

It's tight, but not touching the front seats, unless you have to have the front seats all the way back for some reason. I can't say enough good things about the car seat in general, and I can vouch that it absolutely fits in that exact car. My only complaint is that its hard to lift my son out of the car seat because the ceiling is so low, but that's going to be an issue with any convertible car seat. If I could afford it I'd get a car with more headroom or a minivan lol. Its not that its impossible to get him out, I can manage it, its just awkward.   \n",

Also wearing jackets and hoodies has also been shown to not be safe for a similar reason. There are plenty of car seats that have covers that have been tested and proven safe, or manufacturers that will send you covers that are safe :)   \n",

       "      <td>We are going to start trying to get pregnant in a few months or so.  (There is something beyond our control right now causing the fuzzy and slightly unknown time frame.) Besides being afraid of labor, how crazy my mother is and will be, the sudden involvement of family neither of us really see or talk to, and the hormones I'm the most worried about once I give birth and we settle into a routine will I feel like I'm on house arrest?  So far I'm making a mental list of things I hope to do with our little one outside of our home.  While he/she is still pretty small and not really mobile yet I'm hoping to get into some new mother groups and find a mommy centric yoga class and an infant exercise/bonding class.  Once he/she's a toddler then trips to the zoo and family day at the art museum.\\n\\n\\nAfter my sister-in-law had her baby she turned into an avid Facebook user.  I believe it was her way of staying in contact with her friends and filling the void of not being away from home everyday interacting with a lot people.  Maybe you and your friends already use Facebook.  As long as you don't overload your updates about your little one it seems like a nice way to stay in the loop.  Emails and texts just feel like they need to be responded to too quickly and sometimes phone calls come at the worst time possible.  \\n\\n\\nI hope everything works out so your baby is born in October.  I was sort of hoping to not be in my second or third trimester in the summer, but the way things are going we are going to have a fall or winter baby, too.  Any thoughts on being pregnant during the summer?  The heat and humidity already zaps all my energy to begin with.  So, I can't imagine being 25 pounds heavier and short of breath when the heat index is 100.</td>\n",

Sure, you could get pregnant the first month off the IUD, but it usually takes a few months even for perfectly healthy couples.  Don't count on your Halloween baby.  \"The crazy crying period\" is called postpartum depression and not all new mothers get it.  I never did.  If you are afraid of getting frustrated with your child and you haven't even gotten pregnant yet, you may want to re-evaluate if you are really ready for a child.  All new mothers need a support network.  Get out and join moms groups in your area to meet other moms and babies to play with, especially if you are planning to become a SAHM. Also, don't map out a birth plan...none of them go as expected...babies have their own plans.     \n",
       "4  We are going to start trying to get pregnant in a few months or so.  (There is something beyond our control right now causing the fuzzy and slightly unknown time frame.) Besides being afraid of labor, how crazy my mother is and will be, the sudden involvement of family neither of us really see or talk to, and the hormones I'm the most worried about once I give birth and we settle into a routine will I feel like I'm on house arrest?  So far I'm making a mental list of things I hope to do with our little one outside of our home.  While he/she is still pretty small and not really mobile yet I'm hoping to get into some new mother groups and find a mommy centric yoga class and an infant exercise/bonding class.  Once he/she's a toddler then trips to the zoo and family day at the art museum.\\n\\n\\nAfter my sister-in-law had her baby she turned into an avid Facebook user.  I believe it was her way of staying in contact with her friends and filling the void of not being away from home everyday interacting with a lot people.  Maybe you and your friends already use Facebook.  As long as you don't overload your updates about your little one it seems like a nice way to stay in the loop.  Emails and texts just feel like they need to be responded to too quickly and sometimes phone calls come at the worst time possible.  \\n\\n\\nI hope everything works out so your baby is born in October.  I was sort of hoping to not be in my second or third trimester in the summer, but the way things are going we are going to have a fall or winter baby, too.  Any thoughts on being pregnant during the summer?  The heat and humidity already zaps all my energy to begin with.  So, I can't imagine being 25 pounds heavier and short of breath when the heat index is 100.   \n",

       "18        Just go with the flow.  As for the pre-baby training... Don't worry about it.  When you become a mom, nature kicks in.  It's absolutely amazing.  Spacing them out... that's a personal preference.  My kids are 19 months apart, different sexes, and fight like cats and dogs.  But they're each other's greatest ally.  It's not so hard managing two small children.  It just becomes how things are and you go with the flow.  But I know people who have waited a few years between kids and prefer it that way.  The older child can have a small role in caring for the baby and teaching it new things as it gets older.  You'll know more about what you want in that area when you have your first.  One of my sisters had a baby and when he was a year old, she immediately started wanting another little baby.  My other sister had a little girl and doesn't want to share the time she has with her daughter with another baby for a few years.  It just all depends.  Good luck!  And stop stressing!!\n",

I really like hearing them tell me about their day when they've been to preschool, they're just so much fun.  Babies are sweet and cute but I feel like I didn't really get a chance to enjoy them as much when they were younger because I was spending every second tending to their needs and had very little downtime (they're twins).  Now that they're getting a little older I have a little breathing room to enjoy them for the people they're becoming.\n",

My kids are now 5, almost 10 and almost 12. Since the youngest is a bit more independent I've been able to enjoy the older kids phases more. I love each phase they are in right now. #1 is no longer a kid and I am starting to see glimpses of the young man he's becoming. #2 is growing up but he is still a kid that likes to play with his toys and #3 is discovering school. It's great!\n",

Besides being afraid of labor, how crazy my mother is and will be, the sudden involvement of family neither of us really see or talk to, and the hormones I'm the most worried about once I give birth and we settle into a routine will I feel like I'm on house arrest?  So far I'm making a mental list of things I hope to do with our little one outside of our home.  While he/she is still pretty small and not really mobile yet I'm hoping to get into some new mother groups and find a mommy centric yoga class and an infant exercise/bonding class.  Once he/she's a toddler then trips to the zoo and family day at the art museum.\\n\\n\\nAfter my sister-in-law had her baby she turned into an avid Facebook user.  I believe it was her way of staying in contact with her friends and filling the void of not being away from home everyday interacting with a lot people.  Maybe you and your friends already use Facebook.  As long as you don't overload your updates about your little one it seems like a nice way to stay in the loop.  Emails and texts just feel like they need to be responded to too quickly and sometimes phone calls come at the worst time possible.  \\n\\n\\nI hope everything works out so your baby is born in October.  I was sort of hoping to not be in my second or third trimester in the summer, but the way things are going we are going to have a fall or winter baby, too.  Any thoughts on being pregnant during the summer?  The heat and humidity already zaps all my energy to begin with.  So, I can't imagine being 25 pounds heavier and short of breath when the heat index is 100.</td>\n",

Sure, you could get pregnant the first month off the IUD, but it usually takes a few months even for perfectly healthy couples.  Don't count on your Halloween baby.  \"The crazy crying period\" is called postpartum depression and not all new mothers get it.  I never did.  If you are afraid of getting frustrated with your child and you haven't even gotten pregnant yet, you may want to re-evaluate if you are really ready for a child.  All new mothers need a support network.  Get out and join moms groups in your area to meet other moms and babies to play with, especially if you are planning to become a SAHM. Also, don't map out a birth plan...none of them go as expected...babies have their own plans.     \n",
       "4  We are going to start trying to get pregnant in a few months or so.  (There is something beyond our control right now causing the fuzzy and slightly unknown time frame.) Besides being afraid of labor, how crazy my mother is and will be, the sudden involvement of family neither of us really see or talk to, and the hormones I'm the most worried about once I give birth and we settle into a routine will I feel like I'm on house arrest?  So far I'm making a mental list of things I hope to do with our little one outside of our home.  While he/she is still pretty small and not really mobile yet I'm hoping to get into some new mother groups and find a mommy centric yoga class and an infant exercise/bonding class.  Once he/she's a toddler then trips to the zoo and family day at the art museum.\\n\\n\\nAfter my sister-in-law had her baby she turned into an avid Facebook user.  I believe it was her way of staying in contact with her friends and filling the void of not being away from home everyday interacting with a lot people.  Maybe you and your friends already use Facebook.  As long as you don't overload your updates about your little one it seems like a nice way to stay in the loop.  Emails and texts just feel like they need to be responded to too quickly and sometimes phone calls come at the worst time possible.  \\n\\n\\nI hope everything works out so your baby is born in October.  I was sort of hoping to not be in my second or third trimester in the summer, but the way things are going we are going to have a fall or winter baby, too.  Any thoughts on being pregnant during the summer?  The heat and humidity already zaps all my energy to begin with.  So, I can't imagine being 25 pounds heavier and short of breath when the heat index is 100.   \n",
